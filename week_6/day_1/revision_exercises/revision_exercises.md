# Revision Exercises - Loops, Conditionals, ArrayLists

## Task One
1. Create an `ArrayList` of type `String` called `names`.
2. Add a few names to the list.
3. Write a `for` loop which loops over the list, printing out each name in the list.

## Task Two
1. Create two `ArrayList`s of type `Integer`: one called `oddNumbers`, the other called `evenNumbers`.
2. Write a `for` which runs 20 times ___HINT___ you might want to us the 'classic' `for` loop. 
3. Inside the loop, check if the variable is an even number. If it is, then add it to `evenNumbers`, otherwise add it to `oddNumbers`.
